The [BlueGreen labs](https://bluegreenlabs.org) open-science resources provide free tools to manage, access and model environmental data. Projects consist of output of formal research lines, software and hardware implementations through which BlueGreen tries to give back to the open-source scientific community. Below you find a short list with links to our most popular projects. BlueGreen Labs functions as a software steward for the listed projects. However, due to poor scope of the [European Union Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA) regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act), if formal support is needed we are required to charge you for a new bespoke open-source software copy (regardless of it being open-source already). The price will be set by the potential liability incured.  As such, BlueGreen Labs does not monetize any of the projects below.

If you find anything missing, a software bug or want to add documentation we refer to [our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/policies/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please be mindfull of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/policies/blob/main/CONDUCT.md) and [consultancy policy](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/policies/blob/main/CONSULTANCY.md) within the context of open source software development. Our time and expertise is valuable, to quickly pick our brains, problem-solving, validation and insights please [book an appointment](https://calendly.com/info-clo2/bluegreen-labs-office-hours).
